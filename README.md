## Schema

We recommend using HTTPS for all API access. All data is received as JSON, and all image uploads are to be performed as form-data (POST request). Incase of a pdf file input, the key name has to be `pdf` and in all other cases, the key name for the image could be anything apart from `pdf`.

## Parameters
All optional and compulsory parameters are passed as part of the request body.

## Root Endpoint
A `GET` request can be issued to the root endpoint to check for successful connection :

	 curl https://apac.docs.hyperverge.co/v1.1

The `plain/text` reponse of `"AoK!"` should be received.

## Authentication

Currently, a simple appId, appKey combination is passed in the request header. The appId and appKey are provided on request by the HyperVerge team. If you would like to try the API, please reach out to contact@hyperverge.co

	curl -X POST http://apac.docs.hyperverge.co/v1.1/readNID \
	  -H 'appid: xxx' \
	  -H 'appkey: yyy' \
	  -H 'content-type: multipart/form-data;' \
	  -F 'image=@abc.png'


On failed attempt with invalid credentials or unauthorized access the following error message should be received :

	{
	  "status": "failure",
	  "statusCode": "401",
	  "error": {
	    "developerMessage": "unauthorized",
	  }
	}

Please do not expose the appid and appkey on browser applications. In case of a browser application, set up the API calls from the server side.

## Media Types

Currently, `jpeg, png and tiff` images and `pdf` are supported by the HyperVerge Docs image extraction APIs.

## Supported APIs

Can be used to extract information from any or one of the supported documents depending on the endpoint.

* **NID**
	*  **URL**
		* /readNID : used for any of the supported Vietnam National ID documents
	* **Method:** `POST`
	* **Header**
		- content-type : 'formdata'
		- appid
		- appkey
	* **Request Body**
		- 1-2 images or pdfs
	* **Success Response:**
	    * **Code:** 200 <br />
	    * Incase of a properly made request, the response would follow schema.


			```
			{
				"status" : "success",
				"statusCode" : "200",
				"result" : <resultObject>
			}
			```

		    The `resultObject` has the following Schema :

	        ```
			[{
				"details" : {
					"field-1" : {
					    "value" : "extracted-value-1",
					    "conf" : <float-value>,
					    "to-be-reviewed" : "yes/no"
					},
					"field-2" : {
					    "value" : "extracted-value-2",
					    "conf" : <float-value>,
					    "to-be-reviewed" : "yes/no"
					},
					"field-3" : {
					    "value" : "extracted-value-3",
					    "conf" : <float-value>,
					    "to-be-reviewed" : "yes/no"
					},
					..
				},
				"type" : "id_type"
			}]
			```
        
	* **Fraud Check:**
		We check two types of fraud:
		- **Black and White** Check if the image is Black and White. True if `isBlackWhite` is `yes`.
		- **Province to National ID Mapping** Fixed mapping exists between the ID number and the province. We check if this holds true. If the ID Number does not match the province, `provinceMismatch` is `yes`.
		
		The response will have key `fraudCheck` inside the key `details`: 
		
		```json
		[{
			"details" : {
				"fraudCheck": {
				    "isBlackWhite": "yes/no",
				    "provinceMismatch": "yes/no"
				},
				"field-1" : {
				    "value" : "extracted-value-1",
				    "conf" : <float-value>,
				    "to-be-reviewed" : "yes/no"
				},
				"field-2" : {
				    "value" : "extracted-value-2",
				    "conf" : <float-value>,
				    "to-be-reviewed" : "yes/no"
				},
				"field-3" : {
				    "value" : "extracted-value-3",
				    "conf" : <float-value>,
				    "to-be-reviewed" : "yes/no"
				},
				..
			},
			"type" : "id_type"	
		}]
		```
		
		`fraudCheck` key will be present only if `id_type` is `id_front` or `id_new_front`
		
	* **Split Address:**
		We split address extracted from the NationalId into province, ward, street and disctrict, if `enableAddressSplit` is `true`. By default, this value is `false`. 
		
		The response will have key `address_split` inside the key `details`: 
		
		```json
		[{
			"details" : {
				"address_split": {
				    "province": "extracted_province",
				    "ward": "extracted_ward",
				    "street": "extracted_street",
				    "district": "extracted_district"
				},
				"field-1" : {
				    "value" : "extracted-value-1",
				    "conf" : <float-value>,
				    "to-be-reviewed" : "yes/no"
				},
				"field-2" : {
				    "value" : "extracted-value-2",
				    "conf" : <float-value>,
				    "to-be-reviewed" : "yes/no"
				},
				"field-3" : {
				    "value" : "extracted-value-3",
				    "conf" : <float-value>,
				    "to-be-reviewed" : "yes/no"
				},
				..
			},
			"type" : "id_type"	
		}]
		```
		
		
	* **Error Response:**
		There are 3 types of request errors and `HTTP Status Code 400` is returned in all 3 cases:
		- No Image input

			```       
	      	{
	        	"status": "failure",
	        	"statusCode": "400",
	        	"error": "API call requires atlest one input image"
	      	}
			```

		- More than 2 image input

			```       
	      	{
	        	"status": "failure",
	        	"statusCode": "400",
	        	"error": "API call handles only upto 2 images"
	      	}
			```       

		- Larger than allowed image input

			```       
	      	{
	        	"status": "failure",
	        	"statusCode": "400",
	        	"error": "image size cannot be greater than 6MB"
	      	}
			```       

		All error messages follow the same syntax with the statusCode and status also being a part of the response body, and `string` error message with the description of the error.

		**Server Errors**
		We try our best to avoid these errors, but if by chance they do occur the response code will be 5xx.

## Confidence Score for Prediction

For any field which is extracted from the document, the confidence score would be reported in the key `"conf"`. The score would be a float value between 0 and 1.  The key `"to-be-reviewed"` takes the values `"yes/no"`, `yes` indicates that the field is flagged for manual review.

## Data logging and clientId

These optional params are used to facilitate better debugging of the system. 

`clientId` is a unique identifier that is assigned to the end customer by the API user. This would need to be passed in the request body. And the parameter, would be the 
same for the different API calls made for the of same customer.

By default, the input images are not stored by HyperVerge systems, however, if the user sets the optional parameter `dataLogging` to string value "yes", then the images will be stored and the requestId can be 
provided to HyperVerge to check the uploaded image incase of an inaccurate extraction.
